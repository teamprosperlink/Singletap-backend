Setup Module: Initialization scripts for Qdrant and database setup.

This module contains scripts for:
- Creating Qdrant collections
- Resetting vector databases
- Initial database configuration

# Import them individually if needed:
# from .qdrant_setup import reset_collections, create_collections, run_setup
